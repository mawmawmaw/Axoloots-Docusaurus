# Introduction to Wetlands

## Current state of wetlands

In recent decades, natural ecosystems have suffered dramatic deteriorations due to major driving forces, such as population and economic growth. Wetland ecosystems have been subject to those driving forces and thus, have had to endure various anthropological pressures that have promoted their degradation. Global and regional natural WET (Wetland Extent Trends) indices show a declining trend over time. The global WET index weighted by regions declined by 35% between 1970 and 2015 (Darrah, Shennan-Farpón, Finlayson, Gardner, Walpole, 2018). There are several pressures associated with the conversion of wetlands, such as the extraction of fresh water, pollution by garbage dumps, the development of tourism projects and of urban-industrial zones.

Wetlands provide important ecosystem services such as food production, purification of water, they act as important groundwater seepage and recharge zones, reduce soil erosion, provide refuge areas for wildlife, capture carbon, and contribute to sediment retention, promoting soil fertility. Mexico has 6,331 wetlands that are equivalent to 9 million 924 thousand 624 ha, which represents 5% of the national territory. Of this total, 38% are marshy, 31% fluvial, 15% estuarine, 8% lacustrine and 8% created (SEMARNAT, 2014). It is estimated that the rate of loss of wetlands in Mexico is 0.42% annually and that in the last 30 to 40 years 6,968,452 ha of this valuable ecosystem have been lost (SEMARNAT, 2014).


## State of Wetland in Mexico City

In Mexico City there is an emblematic wetland, Lake Xochimilco, which is the last remnant of the five great lakes that made up the Valley of Mexico Basin. This ecosystem provides important heritage as it is the habitat of a large number of species of flora and fauna, some of which are endemic; In addition, it serves as a feeding area for migratory birds. It is an important ecosystem for the water cycle of the megalopolis and protects a form of cultivation that has been considered unique in the world: the [chinampería](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinampa) (CONANP, 2004).

The wetland belonged to a large endorheic water system that had the presence of five large lakes: Lake Chalco and Xochimilco made up of fresh water; the one of Texcoco, Zumpango and the Xaltocan of brackish water. The original extension of the lacustrine system covered 2100 km2 (Brockmann, 2004). However, the growth of the city has been modifying the polygon, and thus diminishing its size to approximately 1.33% of the original extension (Ruíz-Angulo, 2015).

The DPSIR (Drivers, Pressures, State, Impact, Responses) Framework, as shown in Diagram 1, is used to explain the relationship between the origins and consequences of environmental problems that have occurred in the Xochimilco wetland.

The main driving forces that have transformed the wetland of Xochimilco is population and economic growth. These major driving forces have caused pressures on the environment such as an increase in water use for irrigation and drinking purposes, contamination of water and soil, primarily by the usage of agrochemical, discharge of waste into wetlands, such as sewage water, introduction of invasive species (carps and tilapia) to promote economic growth in the area, the conversion of wetlands to intensive and extensive agricultural areas, soccer fields and urban spaces, and finally, tourism. The pressures exerted on the environment have caused changes in the state of the ecosystem by changing their hydrological dynamics, and abiotic and biotic variables. The changes in the state of the environment have caused impacts such as the decrease in biodiversity, in particular, the substantial reduction in the population of the axolotl, the decrease in agricultural productivity, the reduction in water and soil quality, and the emission of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. The impacts on the wetland have caused responses from local and global institutions, the major ones being the ones listed below (Vázquez, 2018):

 · 1987- Declared Cultural Heritage of Humanity by UNESCO
 · 1992- Declared a Natural Protected Area (NPA) under the category of Zone Subject to Ecological Conservation.
 · 2004- Included in the list of Wetlands of International Importance (RAMSAR site)
 · 2013- Recognized in the International Network of Cities with Intangible Heritage (ICCN)
 · 2017- Declared important world agricultural heritage system by FAO

Despite all the government instruments and protection mechanisms that have been developed to protect the ecosystem so far, it is troublesome that no successful experiences have been documented that reflect an evident transformation in Xochimilco. As a consequence, to date, the wetland is at risk of losing the Declaration of Cultural Heritage of Humanity. Furthermore, the axolotl, which is an endemic amphibian of Xochimilco, distinguished by its historical, current and biological cultural importance, and fundamental in the structure of the food web; being a top predator it can modulate and modify the structure of said network to ensure that there is greater diversity in the water (Zambrano, 2014), is at major risk.

Due to the rapid and alarming population decline of the axolotl in consequence of the changes in the state of the environment, in 1975 it was included in "Appendix II" of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES) with which the regulation of its trade at the international level was achieved. In Mexico, it was included in the NOM-059-ECOL-1994 as a species "subject to special protection (PR)" and, in 2010, it was recategorized as an "endangered species (P)". On the other hand, the International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN) considers it in the category of "critically endangered (CR)". It is also currently one of the 51 priority species of the Priority Species Conservation Program (PROCER) that the National Commission of Natural Protected Areas (CONANP) has been working on since 2007.

**Symbiotik, through Axoloots, aims to protect the axolotl, whilst reducing the environmental pressures that have caused the negative changes in the condition of the wetland of Xochimilco.**
