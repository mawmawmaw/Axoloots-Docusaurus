## Introduction to economical valuation

The implementation of the regeneration technique called “Micro-Reserve” generates a positive impact on the environment as several ecosystem services are enhanced and produced. Ecosystem services are defined as the contributions of ecosystems to the benefits that are used in economic and other human activity (United Nations, 2021).

The United Nations-led Millennium Ecosystem Assessment classified for the first time the ecosystem services as provisioning, regulating, cultural, and supporting services (Millenium Ecosystem Assessment, 2005). This classification is a holistic concept which is best elucidated in these four categories. However, due to the complexity of ecosystems, a consensus is still lacking on a coherent and integrated approach to ecosystem services assessments. Research efforts to address this are ongoing; standardization in describing ecosystem services is a requirement if these values are to be captured by ecosystem accounting methods. This has led to the development of a Common International Classification of Ecosystem Services (CICES) by the European Environment Agency (EEA). CICES identifies three categories of ecosystem services—provisioning, regulation and maintenance, and cultural (Aulia, F., Sandhu, Millington, C., 2020).

The Common International Classification of Ecosystem Services (CICES) has been designed to help measure, account for and evaluate ecosystem services. Although it was developed in the context of work on the System of Environmental and Economic Accounting (SEEA) that is being led by the United Nations Statistics Division (UNSD), it has been used extensively in ecosystem services research to design indicators, mapping and for valuation (Haines-Young, R. and MB Potschin, 2018).

In addition to providing a way to classify ecosystem services, the CICES was also intended as a reference classification that would allow translation between different ecosystem service classification systems, such as those used by the Millennium Ecosystem Assessment (MA), and The Economics of Ecosystems and Biodiversity (TEEB) (Haines-Young, R. and M.B. Potschin, 2018).

The cascade model (Diagram 2) provides the conceptual framework in which CICES is established. CICES seeks to classify the final ecosystem services. The final ecosystem services are those ecosystem services in which the user of the service is an economic unit (United Nations, 2021). The supply of an ecosystem service will be associated with an ecosystem structure or process or a combination of ecosystem structures and processes that reflect the biological, chemical and physical interactions among ecosystem components (Haines-Young, R. and M.B. Potschin, 2018).







***Diagram 2***: *Cascade Framework (Haines-Young, R. and M.B. Potschin, 2018)*





A fundamental characteristic of final services is that they maintain a connection with the underlying functions, processes and structures of the ecosystem that generate them. The final services connect intermediate services with the production boundary of goods and services. On the "supply side" of the cascade inside the environment, the idea of ​​"function" is used to highlight those characteristics of the living system that come together to make something a final service. (Haines-Young, R. and M.B. Potschin, 2018).

Services, in the cascade framework, give rise to goods and benefits, for example, in the case of wood, when it is harvested and the "production frontier" is crossed. The concepts of goods and benefits are considered essentially the same sorts of things in the cascade model; they are removed in one step from the ecosystem and are the things that ultimately have value to people. Goods are sometimes considered to represent more tangible things, such as processed wood that can have a monetary value. In some situations, the "products" of the ecosystem may be less tangible, and in this case they are often simply described as benefits. In the case of forests, for example, these may include the provision of a forest structure that facilitates recreation as a cultural service. (Haines-Young, R. and M.B. Potschin, 2018).

Although the threshold of what constitutes a final service is well defined in theory, in practice whether something is considered a final service depends on the context. For example, if the water from a lake is used directly as a drinking source, then it could be considered as a final service. However, if the focus is on the recreational fishing service, the fish caught would be considered a final service. This means that each ecosystem provides a range of ecosystem services that contribute to human benefit in many different ways, depending on the context. (Haines-Young, R. and M.B. Potschin, 2018).


The problem of context dependence makes it difficult to classify the final ecosystem services. Therefore, while CICES seeks to provide a classification of final services, the developed table should be considered to provide a classification of potential final services (i.e., assumptions). It is up to the user to decide whether in a particular application context, the service should be considered final or not, or whether the particular property or behavior of the ecosystem is considered to have a more 'intermediate' state (and therefore could be better described through an assessment of the condition of the ecosystem). (Haines-Young, R. and M.B. Potschin, 2018).

Services are conceptually different from benefits because things considered as services are still part of the ecosystem that generates them. For the economic benefit to materialize, some transformation is needed through human action or the perspective that lies outside of that ecosystem. For example, in the case of the class "Wild plants (terrestrial and aquatic) used for nutrition", the example service offered is "the harvestable volume of wild berries" and an associated benefit "amount of jam produced" (Haines-Young, R. and M.B. Potschin, 2018).

Conceptually, the ecosystem accounting framework allows the indirect contributions of ecosystem assets to be recorded as intermediate services. As for final ecosystem services, intermediate services represent contributions to benefits. Thus, intermediate services are those ecosystem services in which the user of the ecosystem services is an ecosystem asset and where there is a connection to the supply of final ecosystem services. Nevertheless, the primary focus of the system of Environmental Economic Accounting, adopted by the United Nations, is on the measurement of final ecosystem services (United Nations, 2021).


## Monetary Evaluation of Ecosystem Services

A number of motivations exist for estimating the monetary value of the environment’s contribution to the economy and people. There is also interest in integrated assessments of the connection between the environment and the economy, in particular understanding changes in broad measures of wealth resulting from human and natural causes, for example, from climate change and biodiversity loss. At the same time, monetary valuation will not be appropriate in all decision-making contexts and, in all cases, it will be relevant to use associated biophysical data on stocks and flows (United Nations, 2021).

There are differences of view concerning (i) the underlying framing for valuation of environmental stocks and flows; (ii) the potential of monetary valuation to support decision making; (iii) the ability to produce reliable estimates in monetary terms in practice; and (iv) the role of national statistical offices in producing fit for purpose statistics in this area of measurement. A number of motivations exist for the monetary valuation of ecosystem services and ecosystem assets depending on the purpose of analysis and the context for the use of valuations in monetary terms. The different motivations point to different requirements in terms of the concepts, methods and assumptions used for monetary valuation (United Nations, 2021).

In ecosystem accounting, the primary motivation for monetary valuation using a common monetary unit or numeraire is to be able to make comparisons of different ecosystem services and ecosystem assets that are consistent with standard measures of products and assets as recorded in the national accounts. This requires the use of exchange values. In turn, this facilitates the description of an integrated system of prices and quantities for the economy and the environment that is a core motivation of the System of Environmental Economic Accounting - Ecosystem Accounts (SEEA EA).

Furthermore, in the literature of environmental economics, it is common for valuation to focus on measurement of the impacts of changes in ecosystem assets and services on economic and human welfare. For example, valuation may focus on measuring the impacts of improved parks and reduced pollution on human health or the impacts of reduced soil fertility on farm incomes. The valuation of impacts, both positive and negative, is an important requirement in the development of specific policy options and policy settings, project evaluation and incentive design. This may include, for example, detailed cost-benefit analysis and the assessment of compensation and damage claims. Such analysis can be complemented, but not replaced, by data from a set of ecosystem accounts based on exchange values, recognizing that more detailed and finer scale data and valuations are required for impact analysis. More broadly, SEEA EA accounts provide a coherent framing for the collection and organisation of relevant data and can support an understanding of micro-macro linkages and the assessment of changes over time (United Nations, 2021).

Generally, where there is a focus of analysis on the inputs of ecosystems to the production of marketed goods and services (SNA benefits), for example agricultural production, there is a good alignment between monetary valuations for accounting or welfare analysis. However, since values recorded in the accounts exclude consumer surplus, monetary valuation undertaken for the purpose of accounting for ecosystem services that contribute to non-SNA benefits will regularly differ from estimates of monetary values obtained in environmental economic studies, potentially by significant amounts. Further, when considering a more aggregated value of an ecosystem, the monetary values obtained from ecosystem accounts will be limited to the coverage of ecosystem services and will be lower due to the exclusion of non-use values (United Nations, 2021).

There are four major value perspectives for ecosystems as shown in diagram 3, and depending on the analytical and decision-making contexts, the value can fall at any point of each quadrant. In an environmental accounting context, the value perspective that is given to an ecosystem asset is primarily instrumental and anthropocentric, as shown by the black square, because it must follow the accounting principles of the System of National Accounts, and thus, for assessing some aspects of nature’s value (e.g., spiritual connections) an accounting framework might not be suitable.





***Diagram 3***: *Spectrum of values attributed to ecosystems (United Nations, 2021)*




[Symbiotik](https://symbiotik.co/) wants to apply a value perspective that encompasses all value perspectives in a balanced and harmonious way, as shown by the blue square in order to not be too one sided in any of the four quadrants, and thus cause an avoidable and undesirable environmental or social damage. For that reason, instead of using an accounting framework, a total economic value (TEV) framework is thought to be more suitable as shown in Diagram 4. The total economic value (TEV) framework is based on the presumption that individuals can hold multiple values for ecosystems and is developed for categorizing these various multiple benefits ​​(National Research Council, 2005). It describes the range of direct use (e.g., biomass harvesting, recreation), indirect use (e.g., air filtration, water regulation) and non-use values (e.g., existence values of specific species) that are relevant in providing a comprehensive assessment of changes in welfare. Within this range of use and non-use values, it is usual to apply monetary valuation techniques that assess values of changes in welfare most commonly approximated using measures that include consumer and producer surplus (United Nations, 2021).





***Diagram 4***: *Total Economic Value Framework (Defra, 2007)*




A range of methodologies are available to value changes in ecosystem services. These values are considered in a Total Economic Value framework that takes into account both the use and non-use values individuals and society gain or lose from marginal changes in ecosystem services. As many ecosystem services are not traded in markets, and therefore remain unpriced, it is necessary to assess the relative economic worth of these goods or services using non-market valuation techniques (Defra, 2007). 

The scope of the first stage of the pilot project encompasses the attribution of monetary value only to those ecosystem services that are directly and indirectly used, while excluding the non-use value. In table 3, the classification of the multiple valuation techniques that have been applied in the environmental-economic community are shown.


## Valuation Techniques Taxonomy

As previously mentioned, following the Total Economic Value Framework, valuation techniques can be applied according to the ecosystem service type of use (direct or indirect) and then, according to the purpose of the monetary valuation, a technique can be chosen if the value of the ecosystem service wants to be reflected in the revealed or stated preference of people.

For accounting purposes, revealed preference methods are used because values are directly revealed in market prices or incurred costs, whereas stated preference methods are primarily used in calculating the value of such services that have a non-use value because a market does not exist for those ecosystem services. For economic and environmental cost-benefit analysis, stated preference methods are used in order to calculate the consumer surplus, i.e. the monetary gain obtained by consumers because they are able to purchase a product for a price that is less than the highest price that they would be willing to pay (Horlings, Schenau, Hein, Lof, de Jongh, Polder., 2020).

For this pilot project, revealed preference methods will be used in order for a starting point to be established. Stated preference methods reveal the maximum willingness to pay (WTP) of people, whereas the revealed preference methods reveal the minimum.



| Use | Revealed preference | Stated Preference |
|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| Direct | Market prices / observed values / similar markets | Contingent valuation|
| -- | Resource / residual rent | Choice modelling |
| -- | Simulated market prices | Open-Ended Response Format |
| Indirect | Averting behaviour | Contingent Valuation / behaviour |
| -- | Hedonic pricing | Discrete-choice / Interval Response Format |
| -- | Travel cost | -- |
| -- | Production function | -- |
| -- | Opportunity cost | -- |
| -- | Cost of alternatives | -- |
| -- | Replacement cost | -- |
| -- | Damage cost | -- |
| -- | Avoided cost | -- |
| -- | Conversion cost | -- |
| -- | Mitigation cost | -- |
| -- | Restoration cost | -- |
***Table 3***: *Classification of Evaluation Techniques*

The type of valuation technique chosen will depend on the type of ecosystem service to be valued, as well as the quantity and quality of data available. Some valuation methods may be more suited to capturing the values of particular ecosystem services than others (Defra, 2007).

As previously mentioned, the implementation of the technique “Micro-Reserve” enhances and produces various ecosystem services, 25 of those ecosystem services were identified, but to start to attribute the monetary valuation of those ecosystem services, 5 out of the 25 were chosen in order to allocate them a monetary value. The ecosystem services that were identified, are classified using the CICES classification are shown in Table 4.

## Ecosystem services in regeneration project

Accounting for ecosystem services in physical terms aims to record, in an accounting structure, the flows of ecosystem services over an accounting period in physical units such as cubic metres and tonnes. Physical quantification commonly focuses on measurement of ecosystem structures, processes and functions; i.e. the supply side of ecosystem service flows but quantification of ecosystem contributions can also take place through a focus on the use of ecosystem services, for example the number of visits to a national park (United Nations, 2021).

The five ecosystem services that were chosen for this pilot project are shown in Table 4 with their corresponding physical metric, the good or benefit that is derived from the ecosystem service, the chosen valuation technique for each service and the monetary value that is derived. These ecosystem services are generated from the implementation of the technique “Micro-Reserve” and each produce a good or benefit to society, and thus, have value to people.

| Class | CICES Code | Physical metric | Good or Benefit | Valuation technique | Monetary Value |
|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| Cultivated terrestrial plants (including fungi, algae) grown for nutritional purposes. | 1.1.1.1 | Gross tonnes of cultivated plants | Harvested crops | Market based | Willingness to pay for the harvested crops |
| Surface water used as a material (non-drinking purposes) | 4.2.1.2 | Cubic metres of water, by type of quality | Clean water for irrigation use
Averting behaviour | Willingness to pay for mitigating the damage on water quality |
| Pollination (or 'gamete' dispersal in a marine context) | 2.2.2.1 | Area of crops pollinated, by type of crop | Reduced / eliminated cost of alternative pollination techniques | Replacement cost |
Willingness to pay to ensure pollination with an alternative, anthropogenic technique |
| Filtration/sequestration/storage/accumulation by microorganisms, algae, plants, and animals | 2.1.1.2 | Cubic metres of water, by type of quality | Reduced / eliminated cost of alternative treatment of contaminated water | Replacement cost | Willingness to pay to treat contaminated water, using an anthropogenic method. |
| Characteristics of living systems that enable activities promoting health, recuperation or enjoyment through active or immersive interactions | 3.1.1.1 | Number and length (hours) of visits | Ecotourism
Market based | Willingness to pay to have an “experience” in the “Chinampas”. |

## Valuation techniques definition

1. Market-based

When a market exists for ecosystem services, then prices of those services can be used to derive the final value of the service. In the case of Xochimilco, recreation and cultivated crops are ecosystem services that already have a market in which they are transacted.

2. Averting behaviour

The averting behaviour method assumes that individuals and communities spend money on preventing or mitigating the negative effects and damages caused by adverse environmental impacts. The revealed expenditure demonstrates the value placed on the associated ecosystem service (United Nations, 2021). In the case of Xochimilco, farmers have already and willingly implemented the “Micro-Reserve” technique in order to mitigate the damage on water and soil quality in the wetland.

3. Replacement cost

The replacement cost method estimated the cost of replacing the ecosystem service by something that provides the same contribution to benefits. It is also known as the substitute cost or alternative cost approach (United Nations, 2021). In the case of Xochimilco, a water treatment plant exists in order to treat the incoming sewage water, and make it suitable for irrigation, even though it is not enough to treat all the incoming residual water that comes from the city. Furthermore, spending has been made on anthropogenic techniques of pollination in order to increase the productivity of cultivated crops.
