# Regeneration Technique: “Micro-Reserve”

## Introduction

The regeneration technique **“Micro-Reserve”** constitutes a conservation model for the rescue of the ecosystem of the axolotl (Ambystoma mexicanum), the charal (Menidia jordani) and the acocil (Cambarellus montezumae), as well as the traditional agricultural chinampa system. This model favors participation, the exchange of knowledge and the permanent construction of a long-term restoration proposal, where it is sought that individuals or groups of people from the chinampas are subject to actively contribute in the amelioration of the environment.

The regeneration technique entails multiple benefits that involve the improvement of water condition, while promoting sustainable productive activities as a strategy to avoid the advancement of urban development in the chinampa´s area. The implementation of the “Micro-Reserve” technique also serves as a source of irrigation water with low salt content, thereby avoiding the salinization of soils in Xochimilco and improving agricultural production.

## General Description

The **“Micro-Reserve”** are secondary canals called *apantles* that are rehabilitated or opened in the contours of the chinampas and to which a physical barrier is installed at its both ends. This physical barrier must guarantee that there is an exchange of water between the acalotes (the main canal) and the *apantles*, but sufficiently hermetic to guarantee the segregation of native species and exotic species. In addition to this, reforestation is needed, using ahuejotes (Salix bonplandiana) at the edges of the *apantle*, in order to stabilize the walls of the *apantle*. These, in addition to withstanding the saline conditions of the water and long periods of flooding, provide shade. This model favors traditional agricultural production systems, such as seed germination on site, and the use of compost, which excludes the use of agrochemicals, one of the major pressures on this wetland.


## Implementation plan

**Step 1: Identification of chinampas**


| Description | In order for a chinampa to be suitable for implementing the regeneration technique, it must have an optimal supply of water from the main canal, in order to prevent the *apantle* from remaining dry.

The number of connections that the chinampa has with the main canal should be identified in order to determine the number of physical barriers that must be fabricated per *apantle* for Step 5. |
|:---:|:---:|
| Resources | Drone |
| Task 1 | Identify the chinampas that are surrounded by water, with at least one connection to the primary canal using images taken by a drone. |
| Task 2 | From the images, identify and count the number of connections that the *apantle* has with the main canal. |



**Step 2: Measurement of elevation**


| Description | The difference in level between the chinampa and the main channel must be measured in order to determine the appropriate depth of the *apantle*. This will ensure the flow of water from the main canal into the *apantle*. |
|:---:|:---:|
| Resources | Flexometer |
| Task 1 | Use a flexometer to measure the difference in level of the chinampa with the main channel in order to know what is the required depth of the *apantle*.

If an *apantle* already exists, then measure its length and width. |



**Step 3: Identification of the initial condition of the chinampa**


| Initial Condition | 1a. Generation of canals | 1b. Restoration of canals | 1c. Rehabilitation of canals |
|:---:|:---:|
| Condition | A canal does not exist at all because the total surface area of the chinampa is covered by soil. | A canal exists but requires the adjustment of its dimensions. |A canal already exists with the right dimensions. |
| Next Step | Step 4a |Step 4a | Step 4b |

**Step 4a: Secondary Canal Opening (“*apantle*”)**

| Description | Involves the removal of soil and / or sediment in order to create a canal with the adequate dimensiones where water from the main canal, (acalote), will flow into. |
|:---:|:---:|
| Resources | Small excavator Human capital |
| Task 1 | Leave soil structures at the entrance of the connections of the *apantle* to the main canal in order to prevent the flow of water. |
| Task 2 | Remove the remaining soil with the excavator to obtain the appropriate dimensions, with a 25 degree slope of the walls. |
| Task 3 | Create a step of approximately 30 linear meters by 30 cm wide and 30 cm deep along the edge of the canal to strengthen the canal walls. |
| Recommended *apantle* dimensions | Depth: depends on the difference in level measured in Step 2 (2-3 meters)
Width: 2 meters ≤ x
Length: 60 meters ≤ x (depends on the length of the chinampa) |
| Next Step | Step 5 |

**Step 4b: Channel Conditioning**

| Description | In order for the canal to be a habitable place for the axolotl, it is necessary to remove the contaminated water and invasive species (tilapia and carp) from the *apantle*. |
|:---:|:---:|
| Resources | Water pump: 5 hp <
Shovel
Lime
Human Capital |
| Task 1 | Place the required soil structures at the entrance of the connections of the *apantle* to the main canal in order to prevent the flow of water. |
| Task 2 | Extract the contaminated water with a water pump. |
| Task 3 | Extract the tilapia. |
| Task 4 | Add lime to the soil in order to eliminate tilapia eggs. |

**Step 5: Segregation of invasive species**

|Description | To prevent the entry of carp (Cyprimus carpio) and tilapias (Oreochromis niloticus), a physical barrier is placed between the acalote and the *apantle*. |
|:---:|:---:|
| Resources | Wooden rollers
shrimp or oyster mesh
Human Capital |
| Task 1 | Place a wooden gate with a shrimp or oyster mesh beside the soil structures at the entrance of the main canal. |
| Dimensions | The measurements of the gate must be adjusted to the width and height of each site, taking care not to leave spaces between the barrier and the canal walls. |

**Step 6: Slope Stabilization**

| Description | Slope stabilization is carried out in order to reduce the pressure on the margins of the canals and thus prevent the detachment of the canals. |
|:---:|:---:|
| Resources | Ahuejotes (Salix bonplandiana)
Human Capital
Stakes
Wire
Mesh
Nails1
| Task 1 | Create a step approximately 30 linear meters by 30 cm wide and 30 cm deep along the edge of the canal to strengthen the canal walls.

If done at Step 4a, go to Task 2|
| Task 2 | Reforestation is necessary along the edges of the canal with ahuejotes (Salix bonplandiana) about two meters high, this will help strengthen the canal walls and prevent them from collapsing mainly during the rainy season. Plant a tree every 2.5 meters to 3 meters Maximum density: 1.5 meters |
| Task 3 | Place stakes along the edges of the canal, with mesh and fencing. |
| Task 4 | Grow grass along the canal edges to stabilize the slope of the canal. |

**Additional information**

The *ahuejote* is a native tree of Xochimilco and a traditional element of the *chinampería*. Due to the resistance of its roots to waterlogging conditions, it has been used since ancient times to protect from the wind and shade crops, as well as to consolidate the walls of chinampas. It is necessary to resume this practice since the current stakes are made with pine wood logs and concrete sacks that rot quickly and are not part of the natural system.

It is not advisable to use metal screens as they oxidize and can alter the parameters of the water. It is recommended that the rollers be driven at least 1 m deep into the sediment. The *zhacaltule* and berro de agua prevent the entry of exotic species (carp and tilapia), at the same time they function as a biofilter that improves the quality of the incoming water to the micro reserve.


**Step 7: Plant aquatic plants**


| Description | It is necessary to make several sowings of previously washed and selected aquatic plants in order to serve as biological filters that will help to gradually improve the quality of the water. These plants also serve to oxygenate the water, provide shelter to the fauna, generate organic matter, and are direct food for herbivores and omnivores. |
|:---:|:---:|
| Resources | Myriophyllum aquaticum, Elodea sp., Hydrocotyle ranunculoides, Eichhornia crassipes, Zhacaltule, Schoenoplectus americanus, Tule ancho, and Typha latifolia

Human capital |
| Task 1 | Plant a minimum of 2 species of aquatic plants along the canals |

**Step 8: Reintroduction of the axolotl**

| Description | Once the apantle is finished, at least 3 months should pass in order to be able to observe measurable changes in the quality of water. Based on a measurement of the biotic and abiotic variables of the environment, ajolotes will be reintroduced into its habitat if the conditions are optimal for its health. |

| Resources | Cage to monitor the population
Human Capital
*the number of axolotls that will be introduced depend on the carrying capacity of the *apantle* |
| Task 1 | Buy the axolotl at a Conservation Management Unit (CMU). |




**Step 9: Traditional and sustainable agriculture, Chapín technique**

In order to preserve the richness of the chinampa soils and maintain good water quality within the *apantle*, agro-industrial fertilizers must be replaced by compost produced on site, to limit both the presence of micro and macro nutrients and sodium, which reduces the productive capacity of the chinampas. The traditional agricultural method of *chapin* is used to produce food because chinampa soils are high in organic matter and nutrients, and if combined with high-quality water, produces highly efficient agricultural production. The water for irrigation and the sludge used to germinate the seeds will have to be obtained from the *apantle* in order to use only water that has been cleaned and a healthy soil, and thus preserve the integrity of the organic product. It is important to generate compost with organic plant residues in order to nourish the soil with organic matter. Due to the uniqueness of the wetland’s soil, the use of biofertilizers is not recommended because it will increase the salinity of the soil, and add nutrients that are already in excess in the soil on its own.

## Maintenance

| Maintenance Tasks | Description | Periodicity |
|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| 1 | Remove weeds and surrounding vegetation when they are over-propagated. | 1 / week |
| 2 | Control the growth of aquatic vegetation, mainly floating vegetation such as lentil and water lilies, in such a way that it does not impede the passage of solar energy that is essential for primary production. | 1/ week |
| 3 | “Manual” oxygenation of the water will help to have a healthier “micro-reserve”, this can be done with a water pump, or / and use the water for irrigation. | 1 / week |
| Resources | Human Capital | Water pump |

## Monitoring

The System of Environmental Economic Accounting of the United Nations proposes to use the Ecosystem Condition Typology (ECT), which is a hierarchical typology to organize data about the characteristics of ecosystem condition. The ECT also establishes a common language to be able to compare different studies of the condition of ecosystems. Ecosystems and their characteristics are highly complex, so the TCE provides a balance that meets the requirements for statistical purposes, as well as being ecologically relevant in terms of ecosystem structure, function, and composition. As different types of ecosystems have different characteristics, and thus will have different types of variables and indicators, the TCE is designed to be universal and can be used as a template for the selection of variables and indicators and to provide a structure for aggregation. The objective of this typology is to be exhaustive and mutually exclusive for all the selected characteristics, variables and indicators. The concepts of composition, structure, and particularly function are quite broad, so they could be interpreted in various ways. The TCE provides specific definitions of each concept to avoid confusion and/or ambiguity and thus be able to ensure the mutual exclusivity of each class. The TCE is composed of 3 groups and 6 classes, which can be seen in Table 2.

Based on the evaluation of examples of existing accounts of ecosystem condition, a set of 6 to 10 well-selected indicators for each type of ecosystem and at least one variable for each of the 6 classes of TCE, may be sufficient to provide relevant information to assess the general condition of an ecosystem asset (United Nations, 2021). 10 variables were selected from a bundle of variables that indicate the condition of the ecosystem from each class characteristics. The bundle of variables from each class were taken from a study done by UNAM (The National Autonomous University of Mexico) (UNAM, 2014). The key variables were selected with the help of a biologist and one of the authors of the study, Armando Tovar, who has been working in the wetland of Xochimilco for more than 10 years.
