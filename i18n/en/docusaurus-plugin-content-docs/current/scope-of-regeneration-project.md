# Scope of the Regeneration Project

## Surface Area Characterization

The remnants of the wetland can be found among the area of ​​Xochimilco, Tláhuac and Milpa Alta, which are political delegations of Mexico City, this area has a wide variety of elements of patrimonial value, due to the fact that the traditional agricultural system, “la chinampería”, which was implemented by the Aztecs, is still in practice. The productive culture of the chinampa represents one of the most significant in Latin America because it is a unique and ancestral agricultural productive system, which has endured over time through its intergenerational practice. Furthermore, the chinampas are an exceptional agricultural system, as it is one of the most productive and sustainable agricultural systems in the world. The productive capacity of the system, demonstrated in the efficiency and intensity of cultivation per unit of planted area and its integration through a millenary social organization, allowed the great expansion of the Aztec city. These are productive, cultural, environmental and social practices of great heritage value that have been able to be sustained over time, despite the radical transformations of Mexico City, particularly due to water demand and urban expansion (Tudela, Chávez, Rico, Ramos, Rangel, 2018).

According to the zoning of the master plan of Xochimilco, Tláhuac, and Milpa Alta, there is an area still dedicated to the agricultural activity of the chinampas of 985.20 hectares, which is represented in green color, corresponding to 12.92% of the total area of ​​the patrimonial management units (UGeP), which are categorical units that structure the Master Plan (Tudela, Chávez, Rico, Ramos, Rangel, 2018).

In this first pilot project, 10 hectares which corresponds to 1.015% of the total area dedicated to the chinampas agricultural system will implement the regeneration technique called **“Micro-Reserve”** for the purpose of reintroducing the axolote to a newly healthy environment. This technique has been developed by combining the knowledge of biologists, environmental engineers and local traditional knowledge in order to come up with a viable economic and social option for farmers in the chinampas to implement and at the same time for it to be a minimal invasive technique that promotes the natural regeneration of the ecosystem.

The 10 ha are distributed among the territory of 2 non-governmental organizations that are working alongside Symbiotik, the names, area and location of this organizations are shown in Table 1:

| Name (ONG) | Area | Location |
|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| Humedalia | 90,000 m2 | 19°16'34.9529"N; -099°05'10.2221"W |
| Chinampayolo | 10,000 m2 | 9°16'40.46"N; 99° 5'38.26"O |
